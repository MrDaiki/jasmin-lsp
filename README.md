# jasmin-lsp
An implementation of language server protocol for the Jasmin programming language.

This project is still in an highly early stage and nowhere near release point.

# install

For the moment, this repo only support (opam)[https://opam.ocaml.org/] as it's package manager. We will soon also support nix.

## opam

You can install the project dependencies by using the following command on an empty switch (just ignore warning, this will be fixed later):
```
opam install ./jasmin-lsp.opam --deps-only
```

(NB : Each time you run `dune build`, this will generate an updated opam file with new dependencies)
